## Overview
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s boston dataset.

In this dataset, each row describes a boston town or suburb. Each row contain a 13 attributes (features) with a target column (price).

The deployed web app is live at https://usa-boston-house-price.herokuapp.com/

This web app predict the house price as a function of their input parameters.


The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pickle
